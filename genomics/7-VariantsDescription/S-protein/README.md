### Residue 921 : Salt Bridge


An A-to-C variant causes a Lys921Gln amino acid replacement in the spike glycoprotein (S) .  S is a homotrimeric protein containing two subdomain S1 and S2 mediating receptor recognition and membrane fusion [[1]](#ref1). The S2 subdomains contain two heptad repeat (repeats of units containing seven amino acids) regions: HR1 and HR2. The substitution we observed is located in HR1 and forms a salt bridge with Gln1188 with HR2. This salt bridge is involved in the formation of a HR1/HR2 hairpin structures [[2]](#ref2). This site invariably contains Lys in all human SARS-related coronaviruses (S protein residue 903) as well as in many other coronaviruses. However, more distantly related coronaviruses including transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), the canine coronavirus (CCV), the feline peritonitis virus (FIPV), and the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PDEV) all contain Gln at the corresponding position [[2]](#ref2). The Lys921Gln change would prevent the formation of the salt bridge with Gln1188 and may have structural and functional implications for the spike protein structure and, consequently, COVID-19 virulence.
